- @Component - Generic annotation applicable for any class.

    * Base for all Spring Stereotype Annotations.

    * Specializations of @Component:

        ~ @Service - Indicates that an annotated class has business logic.

        ~ @Controller - Indicates that an annotated class is a "Controller"
                        (e.g. Web Controller). It is used to define
                        controllers in your web applications and REST API.

        ~ @Repository - Indicates that an annotated class is used to retrieve
                        and/or manipulate data in database.

- Always try to use the most specific annotation possible. That is because by
  using the same, we are giving more info to the framework about our intentions.

- Using the most specific annotation also helps to use Aspect Oriented Programming
  (AOP) at a later point to add additional behaviour. For @Repository, Spring automatically
  wires in JDBC Exception translation features.
